\title{Projection pursuit based on Gaussian mixtures and evolutionary algorithms for data visualisation}

\description{
A Projection Pursuit (PP) method for dimension reduction seeking "interesting" data structures in low-dimensional projections. A negentropy index is computed from the density estimated using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). Then, the PP index is maximised by Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to find the optimal projection basis.

\usage{
ppgmmga(data, 
        d, 
        approx = c("UT", "VAR", "SOTE", "none"), 
        center = TRUE, 
        scale = TRUE, 
        GMM = NULL, 
        gatype = c("ga", "gaisl"), 
        options = ppgmmga.options(),
        seed = NULL, 
        verbose = interactive(), \dots)
}
\arguments{
  \item{data}{A \eqn{n x p} matrix containing the data with rows corresponding to observations and columns corresponding to variables. }
  
  \item{d}{An integer specifying the dimension of the subspace onto which the data are projected and visualised.}
  
  \item{approx}{A string specifying the type of computation to perform to obtain the negentropy for GMMs. Possible values are:
  \tabular{ll}{
    \code{"UT"} \tab = Unscented Trasformation approximation (default); \cr
    \code{"VAR"} \tab = VARiational approximation; \cr
    \code{"SOTE"} \tab = Second Order Taylor Expansion approximation; \cr
    \code{"none"} \tab = exact calculation (no approximation, experimental).
    }
  }
  
  \item{center}{A logical value indicating whether or not the data are centred. By default is set to \code{TRUE}.}
  
  \item{scale}{A logical value indicating whether or not the data are scaled. By default is set to \code{TRUE}.}
  
  \item{GMM}{An object of class \code{'densityMclust'} specifying a Gaussian mixture density estimate as returned by \code{\link{densityMclust}}.}
  
  \item{gatype}{A string specifying the type of genetic algoritm to be used to maximised the negentropy. Possible values are:
  \tabular{ll}{
    \code{"ga"} \tab = simple genetic algorithm (\code{\link{ga}}); \cr
    \code{"gaisl"} \tab = island genetic algorithm (\code{\link{gaisl}}).
    }
  }
  
  \item{options}{A list of options containing all the important arguments to pass to \code{\link{densityMclust}} function of the \pkg{mclust} package, and to \code{\link{ga}} function of the \pkg{GA} package. See \code{\link{ppgmmga.options}} for the available options. Note that by setting the \code{options} argument does not change the global options provided by \code{ppgmmga.options}, but only the options for a single call to \code{ppgmmga}.}
  
  \item{seed}{An integer value with the random number generator state. It may be used to replicate the results of ppgmmga algorithm.}
  
  \item{verbose}{A logical value controlling if the evolution of GA search is shown. By default is \code{TRUE} reporting the number of iteration, average and best fitness value.}
  
  \item{\dots}{Further arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}

\details{
Projection pursuit (PP) is a features extraction method for analysing high-dimensional data with low-dimension projections by maximising a projection index to find out the best orthogonal projections. A general PP procedure can be summarised in few steps: the data may be transformed, the PP index is chosen and the subspace dimension is fixed. Then, the PP index is optimised.

For clusters visualisation the negentropy index is considerd. Since such index requires an estimation of the underling data density, Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are used to approximate such density.  
% GMMs do not have a closed formula for the Negentropy and different closed formula approximations have been implemented. 
Genetic Algorithms are then employed to maximise the negentropy with respect to the basis of the projection subspace.
